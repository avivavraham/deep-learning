# deep-learning #Neural Networks
Neural Networks implementation of the back-propagation algorithm for training a neural network.
work with the MNIST data set that consists of 60000 28x28 gray scale images with values of 0 to 1 in each pixel (0 - white, 1 - black).
The optimization problem we consider is of a neural network with ReLU activations and the cross entropy loss.
The code consists of the following:
(a) backprop data.py: Loads the MNIST data.
(b) backprop network.py: Code for creating and training a neural network.
(c) backprop main.py: Example of loading data, training a neural network and evaluating
on the test set.
(d) mnist.pkl.gz: MNIST data set.
